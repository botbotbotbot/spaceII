an experiment over wires

Do you think READMEs get sad if nobody reads them?

#TODO: give README emotions using python

#TODO: create a translator for cat programming (example: cats walking across keyboards or cats heartlessly murdering woodland creatures).
^^ what does this mean?
^^^^ still wanna know what this means 

#TODO: write output-oriented wrapper for MAS (i.e. dissolve(startFrame,seconds) should return output video and endFrame for next effect to pick up).

#TODO: implement pixel clustering algorithm (pseudocode follows)

-- Divide the pixel field into arbitrary clusters
-- Cue gerrymander
While n<j:
-- Cue scatterblend 
-- Cue gerrymander
SCATTERBLEND
-- For each pair of adjacent clusters, combine if combining would reduce variance. 
-- Randomly slice each cluster in half. Does this reduce the variance? If so, retain the division.
GERRYMANDER
While n<i:
-- n+=1
-- For each pixel on the edge of a cluster, if it fits in better to an adjacent cluster, move it over. Fits in better: lower contribution to the cluster's variance (calculate cluster variance with and without pixel and the difference is the pixel contribution). 

#TODO: creatre a history of mars website that goes pretty far into the future based on futurama events and other stuff like that, but the tone is completely serious.

#TODO: A mobile app that lets you swipe like tinder, but it's to find a couch for the night. think air bnb combined with hotel tonight with some tinder and couch surfing thrown in. esp good if you miss a train in the city, or are traveling cheaply across the contry!

#TODO: a font showcase based on quotes we like from books we're both reading

#TODO: start using jade instead of html (no closing tags, hehe)

#TODO: Make a company that does something super super super conceptual, and make a really convincing website for it, including a national recognition section filled with fake logos

#TODO: A game idea: an elevator that never stops going up. you can choose to stop at floors that keep increasing to let people off an on. you can hear their thoughts, and those change based on who's on the elevator, and what they're doing, or what item they bring on. also all the people are actually cats.


Why don't apartments already have internet? like, why does everyone need to get their own internet, it doesn't make any sense. It should already exist the same way that electricity does, everywhere, ideally in every city, but this is a way to start, right? eesh

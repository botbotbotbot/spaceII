		<h2>Future self,</h2><center>

<center><div style="width:700px"align="justify">
<p>Future self, I write this letter as a 23 year old who knows he needs to think about the future. The first time I set out to write this letter, I stared at a blank page for about ten minutes on my porch before my roommates and minor chilliness coaxed me back inside for an evening of relaxed drinking and smoking. If nights were conscious, that night could not be further from lonely, finding a comfortable place within a large set of nights in which I tell myself I will be productive in one way or another, but then whatever willpower I ostensibly have dissolves and I find myself among friends or the television, drinking or smoking the time away. It feels good, but I hate thinking about it.
</p><p>
The point of this letter is that I don't like my job or the city that I live in, and I need to decide what to do next and where to do it. The idea is that maybe if I spend enough time scuba diving in the depths of my brain's ocean, I will emerge on the surface triumphantly, clutching a roadmap, my ego swelling with newfound meaning, taking proud deep breathes, feeling alive.
</p><p>
Hilariously, the time I spent writing the paragraphs above will go down in my history as yet another elaborate procrastination technique, writing, but still above water, still cautiously contemplating the depths. The irony of this new paragraph is not lost on me. 
</p>
What you have read so far comprises the fruits of three short writing stints over four days. Today I'm writing drunk and high again. But I called it an early night, and, in a belittling gesture of compromise with my sober self, turned on the computer to continue writing. Perhaps what started as a letter to my future self will forever be a diary of procrastination, will ultimately serve as an ego-boost. No matter where I am ten years from now, I can look back and think "look how far I've come."

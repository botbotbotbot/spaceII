        	<h1>Top 10 ways to know you've wasted your entire life</h1>

        	<ol>
        		<li>You spend entire days laying in bed imagining how your more attractive friends are probably laying in bed much better than you are.</li>
        		<li>You're working a dead-end job. Literally. The last twelve people who had your job before you died there. Sometimes you think you can hear their final death sighs as your sit there arranging pens by color.</li>
        		<li>Your parents call you up at least twice a week to tell you that you're wasting your entire life.</li>
        		<li>Random strangers stop you in the street, and ask you if you understand the extent to which you are wasting your entire life.</li>
        		<li>You don't know about any good music. Once, a dragon lord princess invited you to a mating dance, and you put on Train's 'Drive By.' When she hissed at you, you put on 'Soul Sister' instead. She explained that this was one way to know that you were on the path of wasting your entire life.</li>
        		<li>When the dragon lords came down to select who would move on as spiritual beings into the ether world, you were not selected</li>
        		<li>In fact, every single person on the entire planet, even the humanoid race of bat people living underground and eating cockroaches, were chosen to enter the ether world, except for you.</li>
        		<li>You often wonder if you should have studied something different in college. Then maybe the dragon lords would have found you useful.</li>
        		<li>You're not even wasting your life in an interesting way, like playing video games. You're terrible at video games. Once you tried to play Skyrim, and got so stuck picking a name that you tried to kill yourself, which you also failed at. You definitely heard the dragon lord princess snickering at you as you laid in a pool of your own wasted blood.</li>
        		<li>You can't believe how accurate this list is! The dragon lords sure know what online content to reccomend. If you thought this list was just TOO ACCURATE, try <a href="beardeddragon.html">reading about why you don't deserve happiness and are going to die alone</a>. Just kidding. That's a link to a porno the dragon lord princess was a part of. Sorry dude. I mean, at least you're the only one left on the entire planet. Go read a book or something.</li>
        	</ol>

        	<p>Coming up next week: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/xin3FHG.gif">Why it would actually be better if all our organs were replaced by pieces of gold leaf stuffed with jello</a>. AND <a href="tentacles.html">you won't believe who the dragon lord princess is sleeping with. One thing changed his entire life!</a></p>

            <h1>11 reasons fonts are really important and I'm glad I spent 4+ years studying them</h1>

            <ol>
                <li>It's a fun party trick! That beer logo uses Copperplate. Do YOU know which one I'm talking about? You would if you went to college specifically to study it!</li>
                <li>You can impress other humans. The other day, I guessed that a poster used Avenir. It did, obviously. The dude who made it was so impressed, that he told me his heart skipped a beat, sacrified three lizard people to try to win my love, and then followed me to train station.</li>
                <li>You can have opinions on things and use them as a way to prove your worth as a human being! What's the point of living if you don't have any strong opinions? Helvetica anyone?! What, you saw that documentary too, but obviously had opinions on that typeface beforehand, but now have opinions on it in a historical context? HILARIOUS! Let's talk about it for HOURS.</li>
                <li>You can even have opinions on other people's opinions! Did someone use the word font when they should have said typeface? What a fool, better silently judge them. Did someone just call out a poster that used comic sans? Really, you're still on that, dude?</li>
                <li>It's a fun car game! Guess the typefaces that are used on every billboard and poster that you pass. Do the same for street signs! Did you know that highway signs have their OWN CUSTOM TYPEFACE called Interstate? I DO. Good god, what an important thing to be taking up space in my brain!</li>
                <li>Lets you find fault ALMOST ANYWHERE! Sure, that typeface is legible, and makes sense in that context, but look at the kerning between that w and that r. PUH-LEEZE.</li>
                <li>Know more about ad campaigns than other people. Did you know that the Obama change campaign was part of what made the typeface Gotham so popular? Because I do! Why do I know that? Who knows!</li>
                <li>You can constantly feel bad about your own decisions. Did I really use Gotham in that document, even though it's not part of our branding, and horrifically overused since that Obama campaign? Ugh, what's wrong with me. Let's look for a bridge to jump off of before I can make a decision like that again next week.</li>
                <li>Really though, typefaces are basically garbage once they've started to be overused. That's another fun thing about typefaces, if you find one you like, knowing that you might not be able to use it at all in a few years and everything you used it in is basically toxic garbage.</li>
                <li>This is especially true for scripts. But why are you even using a script typeface in the first place you piece of human filth? Those are basically fake fonts, which everyone can obviously tell because the letters repeat. Have you jumped off that bridge yet?</li>
                <li>Not only be able to recognize typefaces, but knowing the history of how they came to be as well. The other day, someone used Bodoni Poster Italic as an example of Bodoni, even though it was created over 100 years later in 1929, and I almost lit him on fire.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>I have so many more of these, but I have to figure out public transportation into the city. Interestingly enough, using public transportation is a skill that would potentially be more useful than knowing lots of information about fonts omg bye.</p>

        	<h1>Top 10 ways to know you've wasted your entire life</h1>

        	<ol>
        		<li>You spend entire days laying in bed imagining how your more attractive friends are probably laying in bed much better than you are.</li>
        		<li>You're working a dead-end job. Literally. The last twelve people who had your job before you died there. Sometimes you think you can hear their final death sighs as your sit there arranging pens by color.</li>
        		<li>Your parents call you up at least twice a week to tell you that you're wasting your entire life.</li>
        		<li>Random strangers stop you in the street, and ask you if you understand the extent to which you are wasting your entire life.</li>
        		<li>You don't know about any good music. Once, a dragon lord princess invited you to a mating dance, and you put on Train's 'Drive By.' When she hissed at you, you put on 'Soul Sister' instead. She explained that this was one way to know that you were on the path of wasting your entire life.</li>
        		<li>When the dragon lords came down to select who would move on as spiritual beings into the ether world, you were not selected</li>
        		<li>In fact, every single person on the entire planet, even the humanoid race of bat people living underground and eating cockroaches, were chosen to enter the ether world, except for you.</li>
        		<li>You often wonder if you should have studied something different in college. Then maybe the dragon lords would have found you useful.</li>
        		<li>You're not even wasting your life in an interesting way, like playing video games. You're terrible at video games. Once you tried to play Skyrim, and got so stuck picking a name that you tried to kill yourself, which you also failed at. You definitely heard the dragon lord princess snickering at you as you laid in a pool of your own wasted blood.</li>
        		<li>You can't believe how accurate this list is! The dragon lords sure know what online content to reccomend. If you thought this list was just TOO ACCURATE, try <a href="beardeddragon.html">reading about why you don't deserve happiness and are going to die alone</a>. Just kidding. That's a link to a porno the dragon lord princess was a part of. Sorry dude. I mean, at least you're the only one left on the entire planet. Go read a book or something.</li>
        	</ol>

        	<p>Coming up next week: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/xin3FHG.gif">Why it would actually be better if all our organs were replaced by pieces of gold leaf stuffed with jello</a>. AND <a href="tentacles.html">you won't believe who the dragon lord princess is sleeping with. One thing changed his entire life!</a>

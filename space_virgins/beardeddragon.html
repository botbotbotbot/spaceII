		<h2>career-friendly story about bearded dragons</h2>

<div style="text-align:center;align:center;width:700px"><h2>


<p>John filled up the hot tub. Once the water had had reached the right temperature he motioned Kelly to get in. He looked at her body, taking in her shape. Her full dragons, the curve of her belly, the mound of her bearded dragon and those long legs he loved. As she slipped into the water he turned on the spa and the water began to swirl around her. He stripped off his clothes and sat in the hot tub across from her. He motioned her to him, she rested against him her back to his chest. Looking down he could see her scales beginning to harden just under the water. He reached up from behind her cupping her dragons, and then began caressing them teasing her scales. He heard her moan and this excited him, his bearded dragon began to harden, pressing against her. He rubbed her scales, pinching them making them swell even more. Her hand reached under the water to touch his bearded dragon. He felt her fingers wrap around him, moving up and down. He pushed her forward till she had released him from her grip. 

<p>He lifted her up, making her lean on the edge of the tub. He put his hands beneath her, until her eggs were exposed. He continued lifting her higher until he could see her bearded bearded dragon. He leaned forward and thrust his tongue inside her. Then he slid down to her bearded dragon and sucked on it. Twisting it around in his mouth, sucking it and flicking it with his tongue. She pushed in to him and began to breathe heavily, moaning in pleasure as she came all over his face. His bearded dragon was throbbing so hard now wanting to enter her. He lifted her gently onto him, teasing her, letting only the large head of his bearded dragon enter her. He pulls out, then in again, her muscles gripping him tightly as he teases her. Then he rammed his bearded dragon into her waiting bearded dragon with one movement, burying himself deep inside. They both begin moaning as he thrust inside her, the water splashing against their bodies. 

<p>As he mates with her, he moves his hand across the soft curves of her eggs and rubs his thumb against her bearded dragon. He slips his thumb inside, causing her body to jolt suddenly. The sensation drives them both wild. She moans as he thrusts his bearded dragon harder into her, and then he shoots his hot lizard juice deep inside her. He keeps thrusting hard into her, his orgasm so strong and long. Then as his spasms stop, he eases his thumb from her eggs, slowly taking his bearded dragon out of her throbbing bearded dragon. He slips his fingers inside her, and moves them harder and harder into her until her body shudders as waves of pleasure course through her. She screams out loud and he can feel her muscles squeeze tightly around his fingers as her orgasm explodes in a frenzy of wild pleasure. Their bodies spent, they sit back in the water, the bubbles tingling against their scales, as they sip champagne, letting their bodies relax until they are ready to mate again..

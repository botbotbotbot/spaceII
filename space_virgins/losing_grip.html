<p>I think of reality as a push-up bar. When I was a little boy I kept my fingers clapsed firmly around the bar. A lot of the time I would just hang from the bar and look out, but I used to do pull-ups, too. 
 </p>
<p>Now I am weary. Whatever drove me to raise myself up over the bar is gone, whatever power helps my fingers keep grip is growing weaker. I feel sweat roll from my fingers down onto the bar, my left arm is shaking. I feel my right index finger starting to slip. I'm too weak to save myself. It all starts to dissolve. My fingers first, and then my arm, and then the bar. All of the little dots of color that make up my body fizz like soda and then disappear, leaving holes in their wake. Not white holes or black holes, but perceptual holes. There is nothing to see, or at least I see nothing. 
</p>
<p>I always thought going insane would be more jarring. You bear witness to some sort of catastrophic event, its horrors become inexorably burned into your eyes, you can never see the world the same way again. Your doctor prescribes an experimental antidepressant and now your hands are on completely different bars, and whatever happens when you sleep feels way more real than it ever did before, and so on. But I had a soft landing. What I was seeing made me feel like I was home, truly home, for the first time in my life. 
 </p>
 <p>The plane of dots that color my entire field of vision fizz and evaporate.</p>

<p>You're walking down a street and every time you get to the end of the block the crosswalk timer malfunctions. First there 10 seconds to walk, then you look down and back up again, and the timer reads 12 seconds to walk. You think, "that was weird." The next timer seems ok at first, but then it gets stuck at 5 seconds. You pay close attention to the next timer. 15 seconds, 14 seconds, 6 seconds. Now there is no space between the crosswalks. Your feet leave one crosswalk and step into the next, and looking onto the horizon you see an endless line of malfunctioning timers in parralel. You walk for what seems like miles. Eventually you come upon a timer seems to be working. Then you realize that the man is walking backward.

<p>Today I walked around pretending I had invented a time machine. I wore deep blue jeans, a plain white shirt, steel-frame glasses and a lab apron. I carried an Adventure Time lunch box. On the street I approach people with wide eyes and asked "What year is it?" They respond and I gasp. My wide eyes grow impossibly wider, my mouth opens, my jaw drops, and my eyes move in panorama, taking it all in. After thirty seconds, my dumbstruck expression widens to a smile and I exclaim "thank you!" Then I turn about face and sprint away as fast as I can. 

So far two people ran after me.
